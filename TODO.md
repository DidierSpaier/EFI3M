- Use the output of grub-mkimage -V to check the GRUB version. It should be 2.02 so that the menu can chainload a boot loader built by elilo.
- Set the sound on if brltty is running when EFI3M runs, as with espeak and orca. This could help blind users using only a Braille device but no TTS application.
- Try to play the tune for a menu entry before starting it, so that the user can know in advance which system would boot. Maybe with a fake sub-menu, playing the tune when selecting the submenu, that will contain only one entry.
